Purpose of the CAPM Analysis Web App:

The primary purpose of this web app is to facilitate the analysis and visualization of stock performance using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM is a financial model that helps investors understand the relationship between expected return and risk for a given stock. By using historical data, the app calculates key financial metrics such as beta, which measures a stock's volatility relative to the market, and the expected return based on the stock's risk profile.

Key Features and Functionality:

Stock Ticker Management: Users can add and remove stock ticker symbols to customize their analysis. The app initializes with a default list of popular stocks and allows for easy modifications.

Historical Data Analysis: Users can specify the number of years for historical data analysis. The app fetches data for the selected stocks and the S&P 500 index, which serves as the market benchmark.

Data Visualization: The app displays stock price movements over time through interactive charts. It also provides normalized price charts to facilitate relative performance comparisons.

CAPM Metrics Calculation: The app calculates daily returns for the stocks and the market. It determines the beta value for each stock, which indicates its volatility compared to the market. Using these metrics, the app calculates the expected return for each stock based on the CAPM formula.

Educational Insights: Throughout the app, expanders provide explanations and insights into financial concepts such as CAPM, beta, and the significance of daily returns. This helps users understand the underlying calculations and their implications.

By combining data analysis, visualization, and educational components, this web app serves as a comprehensive tool for investors looking to apply CAPM in their investment decisions.
